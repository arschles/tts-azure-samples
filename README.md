# Welcome :smile:

This repository has Python scripts that show how to do text-to-speech on Azure.

## How to Run It

It's pretty simple! First, copy everything on [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arschles/tts-azure-samples/master/tts-azure.py) into a file called `tts-azure.py` on your computer.

And then run this on your terminal, from the same directory:

```console
python tts-azure.py
```

## Use Different Voices

Check out https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-aaschles#text-to-speech for the list of voices you can use, and set the voice you want to use in the file.

Check out the line that says "Here's where you can set the different voices!" in the `tts-azure.py` file, and it'll tell you how to set the voice you want to use.
